# Flower Classification Model using ResNet and OpenCV with Gradio UI

#Introduction

Classifying flowers based on images is a common computer vision task with numerous applications, such as botany research, agriculture, and image recognition systems. This repository focuses on building a flower classification model using a pre-trained ResNet deep learning architecture, OpenCV for image processing, and Gradio for creating a user-friendly web-based interface to interact with the model.

# Project Overview

# Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

**Flower Classification Model:** Develop a deep learning model using a pre-trained ResNet architecture to classify flowers based on input images.

**Image Processing with OpenCV**: Utilize OpenCV for image preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Create a web-based interface using Gradio to allow users to upload images and receive real-time flower classification results.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises a collection of flower images categorized into different classes, each representing a unique flower species. It serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the flower classification model.

# Flower Classification Model (ResNet)
The flower classification model is constructed using a pre-trained ResNet architecture. Pre-trained models are beneficial because they have already learned rich feature representations from a large dataset, which can be fine-tuned for the specific task of flower classification.

# Image Processing with OpenCV
OpenCV is employed for various image preprocessing tasks, including resizing images to match the model's input size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset for improved model robustness.

# User-Friendly Interface with Gradio
Gradio is a Python library that simplifies the creation of user interfaces for machine learning models. In this project, Gradio is used to build a web-based UI that allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions of the flower species.
